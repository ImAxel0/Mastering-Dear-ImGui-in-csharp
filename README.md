# Mastering Dear ImGui in C# â€“ Sample Chapters

Hi! ðŸ‘‹ 

This repository contains sample chapters from my ebook on using [Dear ImGui](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui) (via ImGui.NET) in C#. The book is focused on helping developers build application user interfaces using immediate-mode GUIs and learn a new GUI library.

## ðŸ“– Read the Sample Chapters

You can [download the free sample chapters here](https://github.com/ImAxel0/Mastering-Dear-ImGui-in-csharp/releases/tag/1.0.0).
